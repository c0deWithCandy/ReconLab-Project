# OpenVAS (GVM) Folder

This folder includes:
- `openvas_instructions.md` — step-by-step install and scan instructions for a lab.
- `openvas_report_template.md` — a Markdown report template to paste/export OpenVAS findings into.

## Notes
OpenVAS (GVM) installation steps vary by distro and version. Follow distro docs if `gvm-setup`/`gvm-check-setup` are not available.

You can export OpenVAS/GVM reports as PDF/HTML via the web UI; then place them in `reports/` and use the provided `openvas_report_template.md` to summarize high/critical findings.
# OpenVAS / GVM - Quick Lab Instructions

1. **Install (Kali modern versions include GVM).** Example (Kali/Debian-based):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gvm -y
sudo gvm-setup         # may take a while (feeds, certs, user)
sudo gvm-check-setup
```
If your distro does not provide `gvm` package, follow Greenbone's installation docs.

2. **Start services** (if not already running):
```bash
sudo gvm-start
# or systemctl start gvm
```

3. **Login to web UI**
Open: `https://<kali-ip>:9392` and login with the created admin account.

4. **Create a Target**
 - Name: Metasploitable2 (lab)
 - Hosts: 192.168.56.101
 - Save

5. **Create a Task** referencing that target and choose an appropriate scan configuration (Full and fast — lab).

6. **Run the Task**. When finished, export the report (PDF/HTML/CSV) from the UI.

7. **Analyze findings**: Sort by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low). For each critical/high item, capture:
 - Title
 - Affected host/port/service
 - CVE (if supplied)
 - Description
 - Exploitability / PoC (if in safe lab)
 - Recommended remediation

8. **Save exported report** to `reports/openvas_target_report.pdf` and summarize key findings in `openvas_report_summary.md`.
