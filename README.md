# Recon Lab — Nmap & OpenVAS Deliverables

**Objective:** Learn reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability analysis, and reporting using Nmap and OpenVAS (GVM).  
**Deliverables in this repository:**
- `nmap/` — scripts to run Nmap and a parser to convert Nmap XML to a Markdown report.
- `openvas/` — instructions and a reusable OpenVAS report template.
- `reports/` — sample (placeholder) reports you can replace with real outputs.
- `demo/` — demo video script, recording steps, and slide outline for a 5-minute demo.

**Important:** This repository contains templates, scripts, and *sample placeholder files only*. I did NOT perform any active scans. You must run the included commands in a legal, isolated lab (e.g., Metasploitable2 in a host-only VM network).

See the `nmap/` and `openvas/` folders for detailed usage instructions.

If you want, I can:
- Run these scripts in your environment if you provide an uploaded Nmap XML / OpenVAS report.
- Or generate a filled example report using a real `nmap` XML you paste here.
